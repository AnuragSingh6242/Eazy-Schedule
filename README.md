# Eazy-Schedule
Projection Exhibiton - II ( Machine Learning )

The project focuses on getting away with the manual complexity students face while formulating their college timetables by providing them a ready to use, easy and efficient tool to automatically generate their timetables using machine learning algorithms.

Specific, to VIT Bhopal each semester a unique FFCS (Fully Flexible Credit System) is provided to the students so that they can make their own timetable. However, many inherent complexities are involved in this process and often the students have to toil hard manually to get their desired and suitable timetable.

This project “ Eazy Schedule – FFCS Timetable Generator ” focusses on creating a user friendly interface where students have the flexibility to add their available options like available teachers, slots, courses, slots, etc. and based on their input choices get a variety of automatically generated timetable samples through the machine learning and computing. 

Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning ( AI&ML ) is one of the rising computing solution due to an increase in computing power. More specifically Genetic Algorithm is a metaheuristic approach that mimics the process of natural selection. It can be applied to different types of problems such as non-deterministic polynomial time problems, to create optimal solutions, in our case the timetable scheduling problem.

Therefore, using evolving computational technology and emerging algorithms, the project generates multiple possible permutations for available timetables as ‘good enough’ or ‘optimal solutions’, with each result fulfilling the constraints initially specified into the algorithm, mirroring real life limitations involved in timetable scheduling.
