**Projection Exhibiton - II ( Machine Learning )**

The project focuses on getting away with the manual complexity students face while formulating their college timetables by providing them a ready to use, easy and efficient tool to automatically generate their timetables using machine learning algorithms.

Specific, to VIT Bhopal each semester a unique FFCS (Fully Flexible Credit System) is provided to the students so that they can make their own timetable. However, many inherent complexities are involved in this process and often the students have to toil hard manually to get their desired and suitable timetable.
